MAKE TIME VISIBLE

Time slips away unnoticed. Stoic Calendar brings awareness through visual grids showing days passed and remaining, home screen widgets that remind you daily, multiple timeline views, and minimalist design inspired by Stoic philosophy.

This Year: 365 squares representing every day of 2026. Watch the grid fill as time passes.
