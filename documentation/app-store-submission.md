## 1. RevenueCat Production Setup

### Current Status
- ✅ Product Catalog configured in RevenueCat
- ✅ Subscriptions configured in App Store Connect
- ⚠️ API Key is in TEST mode

### Production Setup Steps

#### Step 1: Get Production API Key
1. Go to [RevenueCat Dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
4. Copy the **iOS Production API Key** (starts with `appl_...`)
5. Keep it secure - never commit to git

#### Step 2: Update .env File
```bash
# Replace test key with production key
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY=appl_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Step 3: Verify Product IDs Match
Ensure these match in both systems:
- App Store Connect Product IDs:
  - `monthly` → Monthly subscription
  - `yearly` → Yearly subscription (with 7-day free trial)
- RevenueCat Offering identifiers:
  - Entitlement: `Memento Calendar Pro`

**Free Trial Note:** 7-day free trial is configured in App Store Connect product settings. It will automatically appear in purchase dialog - no need to configure in RevenueCat.

- [ ] Production API key obtained
- [ ] .env file updated
- [ ] Product IDs verified
- [ ] Entitlement name matches

---

## 2. Final Testing

### A. Free Trial Test (Sandbox)

**Goal:** Verify 7-day free trial appears in purchase flow

1. Create [Sandbox Test Account](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/testers) in App Store Connect
2. Sign out of real Apple ID on test device (Settings → App Store)
3. Run app in TestFlight or development build
4. Navigate to Paywall
5. Select **Yearly Plan**
6. Verify purchase dialog shows: `"1 Week Free, Then $XX.XX/year"`
7. Complete purchase
8. Check RevenueCat Dashboard → Customer should show active trial

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Purchase dialog shows "1 Week Free"
- ✅ Trial starts immediately
- ✅ RevenueCat shows customer with active entitlement
- ✅ App shows Pro features unlocked

**Sandbox Time Acceleration:**
- 7-day trial = ~5 minutes in sandbox
- Can test full subscription lifecycle quickly

**Test Status:**
- [ ] Sandbox account created
- [ ] Free trial purchase dialog verified
- [ ] Trial entitlement activated
- [ ] Pro features unlocked

---

### B. Restore Purchases Test

**Goal:** Verify subscription persists after app reinstall

#### Test 1: Same Device Reinstall
1. Purchase subscription with sandbox account
2. Verify Pro features work
3. Delete app from device
4. Reinstall app
5. Open app → Go to Paywall
6. Tap **"Restore Purchases"** button
7. Verify Pro status restored

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ After restore, Pro features work immediately
- ✅ No need to purchase again

**Technical Note:**
With RevenueCat-generated anonymous App User IDs, uninstalling the app generates a new anonymous ID on reinstall. Same-device recovery should rely on the **"Restore Purchases"** button in production.

**Sandbox / TestFlight Caveat:**
TestFlight purchases run in Apple's sandbox environment. RevenueCat notes that with anonymous IDs on iOS, sandbox purchases may not restore after uninstall until another sandbox purchase is made. Treat this as a testing limitation, not production behavior.

#### Test 2: Cross-Device Restore
1. Purchase on Device A with Apple ID X
2. Install app on Device B with same Apple ID X
3. Open app → Paywall → "Restore Purchases"
4. Verify subscription restores

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Subscription linked to Apple ID, works on all devices

**Test Status:**
- [ ] Same device reinstall tested
- [ ] Cross-device restore tested
- [ ] Restore Purchases button works correctly

---

### C. Anonymous User Persistence

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// services/revenue-cat-service.ts
Purchases.configure({ apiKey: REVENUECAT_API_KEY });
// No explicit user ID → RevenueCat generates anonymous ID
// Anonymous IDs are cached on device, but a reinstall creates a new anonymous ID
```

**Persistence Matrix:**

| Scenario | Subscription Persists? | Solution |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| Delete + reinstall (same device) | ⚠️ Requires restore | "Restore Purchases" |
| New device + same Apple ID | ⚠️ Requires restore | "Restore Purchases" |
| New device + different Apple ID | ❌ No | Different account |

**No Auth System = Rely on Apple ID**
- Pro: Simple, no login required
- Con: Subscription tied to Apple ID, not email
- Industry Standard: Most iOS apps without auth work this way

**Test Status:**
- [ ] Keychain persistence verified
- [ ] Restore flow documented in app (in Settings)
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully

## 5. ASO (App Store Optimization)

### Pre-Launch ASO

**App Name Optimization:**
- Consider subtitle that includes keywords
- Example: "Memento Calendar - Time Tracker"
- Trade-off: Branding vs. Discoverability

**Icon Testing:**
- Current icon final? (User confirmed: Yes)
- Consider A/B testing post-launch if conversion is low

**Competitor Analysis:**

| App | Downloads | Strategy |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| Life Calendar | 100K+ | Focus on "life" and "mortality" angle |
| Year in Pixels | 50K+ | Mood/habit tracking focus |
| Dreamdays | 200K+ | Event countdown focus |

**Differentiation:**
- Memento = Stoic philosophy angle (unique positioning)
- Minimalist design (less cluttered than competitors)
- No forced social features

### Post-Launch Monitoring

**Tools to Track:**
- App Store Connect Analytics (built-in)
- Impressions → Product Page Views → Downloads (conversion funnel)
- Search terms driving traffic

**Iteration Plan:**
- Week 1: Monitor keyword rankings
- Week 2: Adjust keywords if needed (can update anytime)
- Month 1: Consider adding localized metadata (Turkish)

- [ ] ASO strategy documented
- [ ] Tracking tools access verified
